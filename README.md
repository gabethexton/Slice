#Slice
######A Galvanize Q1 Personal Project
##Project Description
Slice is an interactive story where the reader journeys through the multiverse in second person.
It begins with a brief intro and the user inputting some information that is used to modify the story.
The user inputs their preferred gender pronouns, chooses from a short list of cities to live in, and names a restaurant they'd frequent there.
Once the user submits the form, the story begins with immersive audio and the user chooses their own outcomes.

####Slice was developed as a personal project for my web development bootcamp.
####It uses the following...

####Technologies:

- JavaScript
- AJAX
- Local Storage

####Tools:
- Atom
- Pivotal Tracker
- Adobe Comp CC
- The OpenWeatherMap API

####And would have failed without:
- The advice of my instructors
- The help of my peers
