#Galvanize Q1 Personal Project
-----
##Project Description
-----
Slice is an interactive story where the reader journeys through the multiverse in second person.
It begins with a brief intro and the user inputting some information that is used to modify the story.
The user inputs their preferred gender pronouns, chooses from a short list of cities to live in, and names a restaurant they'd frequent there.
Once the user submits the form, the story begins with immersive audio and the user chooses their own outcomes.
