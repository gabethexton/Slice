      It's the end of a long day and you're so ready to go home that you almost forget your keys.
      You look out the window and it's been `today's local weather verse 1` all day in the beautiful city of `City`.
      You head out the door, turn onto the sidewalk, and run smack into...
    </p>
    <p class="content" >
      Yourself...
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "What the...?!"
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Before the expletive can leave your lips, the other you has turned 180 degrees and is running full speed in the other direction.
      You're not sure why, but you take off full-tilt after `gender pronoun determiner` and really can't gain any ground because the other you is, well... you.
      This is so weird, what's going on? You don't have time to wonder as other-you rounds the corner into an alley about half a block ahead.
      When you finally get to the corner and turn in after `gender pronoun determiner`, you barely get two steps into the dead-end alley before you trip on something and land flat on your face.
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "UNGH!"
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "Sorry." says your doppleganger as you roll over and grasp your shoulder in pain. "What's tomorrows forecast look like?!"
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      You stare in disbelief. "Uhhhh..."
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "C'mon! Hurry Up, what's tomorrow's forecast?!!"
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "Uhhhh..." you reach for your phone, not really knowing why. Stunned is probably the right word for how you're feeling right now.
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "SERIOUSLY!!! I don't have time for this!" `gender pronoun personal` reaches out to grab the phone from your hands but you manage to get your weather app open and announce with a sense of Deja-vu...
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
      "It's gonna be `tomorrow's local weather verse 1` tomorrow! WHY ARE YOU ME?!?!"
    </p>
    <p class="content dialog">
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      `Gender pronoun personal` laughs nervously and starts to back away "I'm not really you, we're just really similar and if that forecast is right, I'm in the wrong verse for s..." Other you trails off and goes ghost white in the face. "We need to go. NOW!" `gender pronoun personal` is motioning toward the brick wall at the back of the alley.
      You jump to your feet and look back to see a man who looks like something out of Mad Max entering the alley.
