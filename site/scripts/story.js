You don\'t have time to wonder as other-you rounds the corner into an alley about half a block ahead. When you finally get to the corner and turn in after ' + determiner + ', you barely get two steps into the dead-end alley before you trip on something and land flat on your face.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"UNGH!"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sorry." says your doppleganger as you roll over and grasp your shoulder in pain.

Hurry Up, what\'s tomorrow\'s forecast?!!"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Uhhhh..." you reach for your phone, not really knowing why.

The only thing is that there\'s nothing there, just a... cut in the air?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything feels like it\'s going in slow motion.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You look back and see the madman charging towards you both.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You and yourself tumble through the cut and land on the ground.

This isn\'t Star Trek, what the heck are you talking about!?"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I\'ll explain later, does your phone work?"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You stare at yourself for a second.

I\'m not you, but in a way I am. You see, the multiverse is essentially about possibility.

Past present and future."<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It\'s a lot to take in, but you nod.

You now realize that it\'s not really a knife, but more of a shard of something, it looks glass-like but silvery and takes on the color of things around it in a life-like way. It almost looks magical. You\'ve never seen anything like it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What the heck is that?!" you ask.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This, my friend, is a Unicorn Horn. Naw, just kidding. This is my blade. Long story short, they\'re super-rare, can get you killed in a variety of ways, and are good for one thing only. Cutting through the fabric of the multiverse.

//     Ch1D: '<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You get about 10 blocks before you slow down and take stock of the situation. You sit down on a bench at a park and look around. You can\'t believe what just happened and the more you look around, the less you believe that it did happen. This is no \'other universe\', everything\'s the same. You\'ve been to this park before. You walk down that street every day. ' + restaurant + ' is right over there, you\'ve been to there at least a dozen times. Suddenly you realize that you\'re very hungry.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You get up and go over to ' + restaurant + '. You\'re still a little sketched out so you order your meal to go. You pull out your card to pay but when you swipe it nothing happens on the tiny screen. You try again but still nothing on the tiny screen.

I\'ll be right back yeah, right back." she says and nervously dance-walks her way to the back of the restaurant.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\'re still wondering where she went when you hear a screeching of tires and a crazy-loud speaker blasts to life.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With your to-go silverware in hand, you turn and look out the window. There are probably ten cops outside with guns drawn and you realize they\'re pointing at you. You go to raise your hands in surrender but the silverware looks oddly like a particular knife these cops are quite familiar with. They waste no time responding and the last thing you hear is the sound of 8 standard-issue handguns firing.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your final thought is confident and crystal clear.

This is a 3rd you.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\'re not in your own verse.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"HEY HEY HEY, It\'s OK!!!
