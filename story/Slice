I believe we exist in a multiverse of universes.

## Prologue

Our world is not alone.

Our universe is simply one verse among many.


Remember that moment last week when you you had Deja-vu?
If you thought it was weird then.
It's about to get a whole lot weirder now...

***

## Chapter 1
`from 1B` `from 1D` `from 1E`
It's the end of a long day and you're so ready to go home that you almost forget your keys.
You look out the window and it's been `today's local weather verse 1` all day in the beautiful city of `City`.
You head out the door, turn onto the sidewalk, and run smack into...
Yourself.
"What the?!.."
Before the expletive can leave your lips, the other you has turned 180 degrees and is running full speed in the other direction.
You're not sure why, but you take off full-tilt after `gender pronoun determiner` and really can't gain any ground because the other you is, well... you.
This is so weird, what's going on? You don't have time to wonder as other-you rounds the corner into an alley about half a block ahead.
When you finally get to the corner and turn in after `gender pronoun determiner`, you barely get two steps into the dead-end alley before you trip on something and land flat on your face.
"UNGH!"
"Sorry." says your doppleganger as you roll over and grasp your shoulder in pain. "What's tomorrows forecast look like?!"
You stare in disbelief. "Uhhhh..."
"C'mon! Hurry Up, what's tomorrow's forecast?!!"
"Uhhhh..." you reach for your phone, not really knowing why. Stunned is probably the right word for how you're feeling right now.
"SERIOUSLY!!! I don't have time for this!" `gender pronoun personal` reaches out to grab the phone from your hands but you manage to get your weather app open and announce with a sense of Deja-vu...
"It's gonna be `tomorrow's local weather verse 1` tomorrow! WHY ARE YOU ME?!?!"
`Gender pronoun personal` laughs nervously and starts to back away "I'm not really you, we're just really similar and if that forecast is right, I'm in the wrong verse for s..." Other you trails off and goes ghost white in the face. "We need to go. NOW!" `gender pronoun personal` is motioning toward the brick wall at the back of the alley.
You jump to your feet and look back to see a man who looks like something out of Mad Max entering the alley.

`choice` You say "OK" and take off running with yourself. - `direct user to 1A`
`choice` You don't say anything, but turn and run back towards the street. - `direct user to 1B`

## 1A
`from Chapter 1`
You're running and yelling at the same time, you can barely get words out but you manage to scream 'DEAD END!!!'
Your reflection looks at you and laughs. 'Welcome to the multiverse!' `gender pronoun personal` says as `gender pronoun personal` takes what looks like a knife out of `gender pronoun determiner` pocket and swings it through the air diagonally. "Are you ready?!"
You look at yourself. "Ready for what?!"
Your doppleganger turns toward the madman and yells at him. "CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, IBO DUET!!!" then grabs you by the arm and thrusts you forward.
It's then that you see what looks sort of like a cut sheer-curtain waving in the air where the knife had been swung. The only thing is that there's nothing there, just a... cut in the air? Everything feels like it's going in slow motion as you and yourself tumble through the cut and land on the ground.

You stand up and look back. The madman isn't there and you look to other you for an answer. "Where'd he go?!"
"He didn't go anywhere. We're the ones that left."
"What the heck does that mean?!"
`Gender pronoun personal` holds up the knife and says, with all confidence, "We're in a different universe now. Well, I mean, it's not a universe, it's just a verse, one of infinite in the multiverse, but either way, we've got to figure out which one it is before we do anything else."
You stutter... "Uni-multi-what?! This isn't Star Trek, what the heck are you talking about!?"
"I'll explain later, does your phone work?"
You stare at yourself for a second. You don't look half bad. I mean for being...
"HELLO!? Does your phone work?! Do you have service?"
You snap out of it and pull your phone out of your pocket. "Yeah, I've got the same service I usually have downtown."
"This isn't your... nevermind. What's tomorrow's forecast?"
"I just told you like two minutes ago, it's `tomorrows local weather verse 1`"
"Check it again and do it quick."
You check your phone and to your astonishment the forecast is dramatically different. "It... it... it says it's going to be `tomorrows local weather verse 2`... how can that be?"
"Like I said, we're in another verse. Things change from verse to verse. One of the most common differences are the weather patterns, and in this neighborhood of verses that's a pretty accurate way of knowing if we're safe or not. This one should be safe enough, let's head to my place, c'mon."
You follow yourself to the end of the alley cautiously. Other you turns left and beckons.

`choice` - You're confused but need to know more so you follow left - `direct user to 1C`
`choice` - You've had enough. You take off running to the right.  - `direct user to 1D`


## 1B
`from Chapter 1`
The strange looking figure at the entrance of the alley watches as you approach.
You hear yourself scream at you from behind.
The last thing you see is a giant sword.
It was a good life while it lasted.

## 1C
`from 1A`
You're a few paces behind so you shout at yourself to slow down. Other you does and you jog to catch up. "I'm going to need some explanation here, starting with who you are and how we got here."
"Now you're coming around to it. I'm not you, but in a way I am. You see, the multiverse is essentially about possibility. What I mean is, in your verse maybe you woke up at 7:02 and seven seconds this morning, but in another verse a version of you woke up one second later, and everything, AND I MEAN EVERYTHING else is EXACTLY PRECISELY WITHOUT A DOUBT the same. Past present and future."
It's a lot to take in, but you nod.
`Gender pronoun personal` continues. "In other verses however, the dinosaurs never went extinct and live along-side humans, and in some, the humans never made it and it's all dinos, all the time. and..."
"But how did we get here?" you interrupt.
"You're tracking? Wow. Ok. I always thought I was a quick learner..." your other self says. "You know, we're pretty smart you and me."
"You and I" you correct yourself.
"Really?" `gender pronoun personal` says, "You guys say it that way? Sounds so weird."
"HOW DID WE GET HERE!" you demand.
"Right, sorry... this." your other self says pulling out the knife. You now realize that it's not really a knife, but more of a shard of something, it looks glass-like but silvery and takes on the color of things around it in a life-like way. It almost looks magical. You've never seen anything like it.
"What the heck is that?!" you ask.
"This, my friend, is a Unicorn Horn. Naw, just kidding. This is my blade. Long story short, they're super-rare, can get you killed in a variety of ways, and are good for one thing only. Cutting through the fabric of the multiverse. THIS, is how we got here."
"Wha...?"
Your reflection starts laughing. "I knew I'd lose you somewhere. We'll work on it later. We're home."

You look up to see your apartment building, but you're at the back entrance that nobody ever uses. You grab the door to open it but your doppleganger sticks `gender pronoun possessive` foot against the base of the door and stops you. "We need to make sure it's clear."
"Am I some sort of crook in this universe?!" you exclaim as you realize how different things are.
"I'm not you and it's a verse not a universe, but crook isn't the word I'd use. Let's just say that not everything I do is appreciated around here."

`choice` - This is too much uncertainty. You demand to be taken home. - `direct user to 1E`
`choice` - You laugh and fling the door open. - `direct user to 1F`

## 1D
`from 1A`
You get about 10 blocks before you slow down and take stock of the situation. You sit down on a bench at a park and look around. You can't believe what just happened and the more you look around, the less you believe that it did happen. This is no 'other universe', everything's the same. You've been to this park before. You walk down that street every day. `Restaurant` is right over there, you've been to there at least a dozen times. Suddenly you realize that you're very hungry.

You get up and go over to `Restaurant`. You're still a little sketched out so you order your meal to go. You pull out your card to pay but when you swipe it nothing happens on the tiny screen. You try again but still nothing on the tiny screen. You look at the employee and she's doing a bit of a thing with her face. "I'll umm.. I'll be right back yeah, right back." she says and nervously dance-walks her way to the back of the restaurant. You're still wondering where she went when you hear a screeching of tires and a crazy-loud speaker blasts to life.
"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!"
With your to-go silverware in hand, you turn and look out the window. There are probably ten cops outside with guns drawn and you realize they're pointing at you. You go to raise your hands in surrender but the silverware looks oddly like a particular knife these cops are quite familiar with. They waste no time responding and the last thing you hear is the sound of 8 standard-issue handguns firing.
Your final thought is confident and crystal clear. "This isn't my universe."

## 1E
`from 1C`
Your doppleganger looks disappointed, but reaches for `gender pronoun possessive` blade. "It was good while it lasted I guess." `gender pronoun personal` says, slicing a rift open. "It was nice knowing you."

You stare at yourself for a moment. Then at the rift. Then back at this strange other version of you. It feels weird to be leaving but you have to get home. "I guess I'll see you around." you say.
"Not likely."
"We'll that's pessimistic of you." you say as you step toward the rift.
"Nah, just realistic." you hear yourself say as you step out of one verse into another.
The rift closes immediately behind you and as you turn to look back, you have a moment of relief. It wasn't that long, but it's finally over. You open the door to your building and step in. Heading down the familiar hall feels good in an epic way. You unlock your door, head in to your apartment, and the world falls apart again.

You're staring at yourself again.

You're pissed. "DIDN'T I JUST LEAVE YOU!? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME HOME!!"
Your doppleganger screams and begins to throw things at you. Your phone, a couch pillow, a picture frame.
"OUCH!" It's then that you realize that this you isn't the you that you just left. This is a 3rd you.

You're not in your own verse.

"HEY HEY HEY, It's OK!!! I'm just you from another verse!"
"WHAT THE...?!" 3rd you is freaking out, `gender pronoun personal` charges at you. You try to dodge, but slip and end up getting tackled backwards into the door.

Everything goes black.

You're out for a long time.
When you come to, you're in a hospital, handcuffed to the bed. You sit up slowly and realize that this is no ordinary hospital. You're surrounded by military personnel and scientists. You spend the rest of your life being examined and trying over and over to explain that you're not crazy, or an alien, or anything like that...

You're just someone from another verse trying to get home.

## 1F
`from 1C`

The door bangs against the wall and you feel bad, you're not usually that bold or hard on things.
Your reflection cringes and looks down the hallway in front of you. You take off towards your appartment with `gender pronoun personal` following behind. You get to your apartment door and your other swats your hand away from the knob.
`Gender pronoun personal` hiss-whispers at you "WE DON'T IF WE'RE INSIDE!"
You pause. "Knock then?"
"Yes. and get out of the way of the peep hole.".
You take `gender pronoun determiner` advice and when there's no response you go inside together. The apartment feels like home, but off, there are little things different everywhere, picture frames are different, the TV looks exactly like your Samsung, but the logo says 'Kor-Tel'. You sit down on the couch in your usual spot to collect your thoughts.

Other you is rummaging through the fridge and exclaims excitedly "There's a whole meal in here from `Restaurant`! Let's eat!"
You're both busy eating when the apartment door opens and another you walks in. You glance at each-other and then back at the 3rd you.
"You guys are idiots, that food is like three weeks old and from a pretty sketchy verse at that." `gender pronoun determiner` says.
You all break out in laughter and you realize how truly strange your day has been and how tired you really are.
It's agreed that you'll take the couch, your 2nd copy will take the spare room futon, and 3rd you will take the master bed, as this is actually `gender pronoun personal` verse.

You don't bother to set your alarm and are out in seconds.

To be continued...
